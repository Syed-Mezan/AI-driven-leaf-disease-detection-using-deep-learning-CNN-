# ðŸŒ¿ Sky Crop Innovators â€“ AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection Using Drones ðŸš€

## **ðŸŒŸ Overview**
Sky Crop Innovators is an **AI-driven solution** that integrates **drones and deep learning** to detect plant diseases in real time. This project focuses on automating disease detection in **tobacco crops** and **apple orchards** using **YOLOv11**.

## **ðŸ”¹ Key Features**
âœ… **Deep Learning Models** â€“ Uses CNN & YOLOv9 for image-based disease detection  
âœ… **Drone Integration** â€“ AI-powered UAV monitoring system  
âœ… **Mobile & Web Dashboard** â€“ Real-time alerts and recommendations  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Can be adapted for multiple crops  

## **ðŸ“‚ Project Structure**
- **models/** â€“ Trained AI models (YOLOv11, CNN)  
- **scripts/** â€“ Python scripts for training and inference  
- **drone-integration/** â€“ Scripts for drone data collection & deployment  
- **web-app/** â€“ Web-based dashboard for visualization
