AI-Driven Plant Disease Detection: This project uses CNNs to identify plant diseases, providing a scalable solution for various species. Tested with tomato leaf disease data, it helps farmers take timely action to improve crop health and yield.

Key Features

-Generalized Plant Disease Detection: Built to classify diseases across multiple plant species with high precision.

-Deep Learning Framework: Leveraging CNNs to process plant leaf images for accurate disease diagnosis.

-Scalable Design: Future-ready architecture that can integrate with drone systems for real-time field monitoring.

-Actionable Insights: Provides detailed recommendations for managing and preventing detected plant diseases.
